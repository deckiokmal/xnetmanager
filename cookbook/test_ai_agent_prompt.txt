Question:
buat konfigurasi simple untuk limitasi network 192.168.1.0/24, minimal bandwidth 1M download, maksimal bandwidth 10M download. buat CIR dan MIR 1:8 dan gunakan burst limit selama 30 detik. konfigurasi pada mikrotik target ip 10.0.102.10

Answer:
There was a syntax issue with the provided command: "expected end of command (line 1 column 90)". Please verify the syntax and correctness of each parameter.


Specifically, it appears there's a mistake around the 'packet-mark', 'target' or other part of the command configuration causing a parsing error. Let's correct the syntax:


We need to use the correct keys and ensure no extra characters are included:



Correct "packet-mark" if necessary

Ensure proper use of IP address and queue type

Ensure there's no "download" after parent


Could you please check these attributes?


Revised command attempt:


/queue tree add name="network-download-limit" parent=global packet-mark=download-traffic target=192.168.1.0/24 max-limit=10M queue="default" burst-time=30s burst-limit=8M burst-threshold=1M

Please confirm or provide correct parameters to proceed.

Question:
cek latency ke facebook.com pada mikrotik target ip 10.0.102.10

Answer:
The configuration command executed on Mikrotik produced errors indicating it was unable to resolve the domain name due to DNS issues. The error message states:



"While resolving ip-address: could not get answer from dns server"


Please ensure that the device can resolve DNS queries properly or try using an alternate DNS service before attempting the command again. The "invalid value for argument address" and "invalid value of mac-address" seems to be misleading and secondary to the DNS issue.

Question:
cek status jaringan ke arah facebook.com pada mikrotik target ip 10.0.102.10

Answer:
The configuration to log ping actions on the Mikrotik device was attempted, but the provided command ('ping 10.0.102.10 count=4') does not directly configure the device and needs to be run manually on the command line interface. I attempted a configuration to log pings, but it returned a message: "input does not match any value of topic".


Please manually run 'ping 10.0.102.10 count=4' on your Mikrotik device to perform the ping operation. The provided configuration only dealt with logging setup.
